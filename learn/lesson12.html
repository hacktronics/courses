        Scratch is a graphical programming language developed by the Lifelong Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab.
        In Scratch, you can drag and combine code blocks to make a range of programs, including animations, stories,
        musical instruments, and games. Itâ€™s a bit like the programming equivalent of building blocks!

        Scratch allows young people to learn coding concepts and create interactive projects without
        needing to learn a text-based programming language. You will not need to be able to type quickly
        or remember complex code to use Scratch.
